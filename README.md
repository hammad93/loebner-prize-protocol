Method:
This chatbot is not based on a rule based engine but uses a statistical inference model. The model is based on
a Markov-Chain approach which is simliar to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in Machine Learning. The advantage of
using this kind of model is the ability to respond uniquely to every input, learning on every input, and responses
on any input. This type of model can be more conversational to some people. The disadvantage a pure RNN based approach
is the absense of any knowledge or logical memory capabilities. The chatbot lacks any induction based logic or
the ability to make inferences.

The Chatbot was able to learn the most popular languages around the world by analyzing Twitter profiles using the
Twitter API. This allows conversational output of the Markov-Chain model. The list of Twitter users and their respective
target languages are listed below.
